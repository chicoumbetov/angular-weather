Deployement to netlify

1. Run npm install netlify netlify-cli -g && netlify login
   npm install -g netlify-cli

Refresh with Redirects
To make sure that your routes work (refreshes, etc. handled by the Angular router) youâ€™ll want to add some redirect logic. One of the most straightforward ways to do this is by setting redirects in your Netlify configuration file, netlify.toml, mentioned above. This is what that file will be like:

2. create netlify.toml file;
3. Paste text which exists now in this file;

[build]
publish = "dist/anglify"
command = "ng build --prod"
[[redirects]]
from = "/\*"
to = "/index.html"
status = 200

4. netlify build
5. netlify deploy
